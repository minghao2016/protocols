# Heat shock transformation of chemically competent cells

## Materials

* LB ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates a 37 °C
* Chemically competent cells (DH5α or Stbl3 for lentiviral vectors)

## Procedure

1. Thaw cells on ice for 15 minutes
2. Add 10 µL of vector DNA
3. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
4. Heat shock at 42 °C for 45 seconds on a thermomixer
5. Place on ice for 2 minutes
6. Add 250 µL LB
7. Incubate at 37 °C for 1H on a thermomixer at 1000 rpm
8. Plate 50µL on LB ampicillin plates
9. Centrifuge at 13000 rpm, discard supernatant,
10. Resuspend in 50 µL LB and plate
11. Incubate at 37 °C overnight
