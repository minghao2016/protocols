# Preparing cells for RNA and protein extraction (6-well plate)

1. Aspirate old media from the wells
2. Add 1 ml of PBS to each well
3. Use the scraper to dislodge the cell
4. For each well, split the cells into two centrifuge tubes (0.5 ml each)
5. Centrifuge the tubes at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes
6. Remove the supernatant
7. For RNA tubes - add 1 ml TriZOL (in the fume hood) to each tube and vortex for 15 seconds to resuspend the pellet.
8. Store the tubes at -80C
9. For protein tubes - add 65 ul mRIPA buffer (-20C freezer)
10. Centrifuge the tubes at 13000 rpm for 10 minutes in the cold room centrifuge
11. Transfer the supernatant into a new set of tubes, on ice
12. Store the protein tubes at -20C.


# Preparing the cell for RNA extraction only (6-well plate)

1. Aspirate old media from the wells
2. Wash with 1 ml of PBS twice
3. In the fume hood, add 1 ml of TriZOL and pipette up and down
4. Leave the TriZOL in the plate for 6 minutes
5. Transfer TriZOL to centrifuge tubes
6. Tubes can be frozen at -80C or proceed to RNA isolation
