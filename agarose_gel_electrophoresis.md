# Agarose gel electrophoresis

## Reagents

* Agarose
* TAE buffer
* GreenGlo (stored at 4C)
* 6X loading dye
* GeneRuler 1Kb plus ladder

## Procedure

1% agarose gel was prepared (0.5 g agarose, 50 ml 1X TAE). The buffer with agarose was brought to boil (~1 minute in the microwave), cooled down, 2.5 ul of GreenGlo bromide was added (per 50 ml), poured into the tray and solidified. Around 250 ml of 1X TAE was used in the electrophoresis chamber. 6X loading dye is used and 5 ul of GeneRuler 1Kb plus was used. The gel was run for 40 minutes at 100 volts. Take a picture with GelDock. Discard the gel in ethidium bromide box.
