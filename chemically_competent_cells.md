# Preparing chemically competent *E. coli* cells

**Transformation buffer (TB) (60 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15% glycerol)**

Prepare each solution separately

* 2.4 ml 2.5M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.764 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> dihydrate, make up to 5 ml with water)
* 30 ml 50% glycerol (v/v)
* Make up to 100 ml with water

Filter sterilize and keep on ice.

1. Streak bacteria on a plate and grow overnight at 37 °C 
2. Inoculate 5 ml LB (no antibiotic) with a single fresh colony and grow overnight at 37 °C 
3. Inoculate 500 ml LB (no antibiotic) with 5 ml of overnight culture
4. Grow at 37 °C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.45-0.55 (~3-4 hours). Use sterile LB as blank, use a plastic cuvette
5. Transfer the culture into a centrifuge bottle and centrifuge at 3500 RPM for 7 minutes at 4 °C 
6. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 60 ml ice cold TB
7. Centrifuge at 3500 RPM for 7 minutes at 4 °C
8. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 ml ice cold TB and hold on ice for 30-45 minutes with occasional mixing
9. Prepare 200 tubes by placing them in ice boxes with dry ice and ethanol 
10. Aliquot 100 μl into sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and store at -80 °C
