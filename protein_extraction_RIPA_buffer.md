# Protein extraction using RIPA buffer

**Work on ice at all times.**

* Prepare the lysis buffer:

 * Add 1X protease inhibitor to the RIPA buffer
 * Add 2 mM of sodium orthovanadate (phosphatase inhibitor) to the RIPA buffer

* Place the cells on ice. If cell plates were frozen, allow to thaw for 2-3 minutes.
* Add 30-500 ul of lysis buffer to each well or petri dish. Let sit on ice for 2-3 minutes.

*Suggested volumes:*

  * 10 cm petri dish: 350 ul
  * 6-well plate: 75 ul per well
  * 12-well plate: 50 ul per well

* Using a cell scraper, dislodge the cells thoroughly. Transfer the supernatant to a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
* Centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4 Â°C.
* Transfer the supernatant containing the proteins to a new microcentrifuge tube.
* Measure protein concentrations with the BCA protein assay.
