# Mycoplasma detection protocol

* Obtain an aliquot of supernatant from confluent cells to be tested. Transfer 50 μL to PCR tubes. Aliquot positive control into one of the tubes.
* Boil the sample at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Spin down in the tabletop centrifuge for 5 seconds.
* While the sample is boiling, prepare the PCR master mix using the following protocol:

| Reagent                   | Volume (μL) |  
| :------------------------ | :---------: |  
| H2O                       |     13.4    |  
| 10X complete (yellow cap) |     2.0     |  
| dNTP (10 mM)              |     0.4     |  
| MYA For primer (20 μM)    |     0.5     |  
| MYB Rev primer (20 μM)    |     0.5     |  
| DFS-Taq (blue cap)        |     0.2     |  
| **Total**                 |    **17**   |  

* Resuspend the StrataClean resin by vortexing until no pellet remains (about 30 seconds). Add 5 μL of StrataClean resin to the boiled supernatant. Mix the resin and supernatant by gently flicking the tube.
* Spin down the sample in a tabletop centrifuge for 5-10 seconds to pellet the resin. Use 3 μL of the supernatant for PCR. Do not disturb the resin pellet!

* Run the samples on the thermocycler: 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 40 sec; 72 °C for 5 min and hold at 4 °C until the samples are removed.

* Run 10 μL of sample on 1% agarose gel for 1 hour at 120 V.
