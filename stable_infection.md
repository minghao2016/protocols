# Stable line infection with lentiviral vector

## Materials

* HEK293T/17 cell culture
* Lentiviral vector midi-prep (cleaner than mini-prep)
* Pax-2
* VSV-G
* Lipofectamine 2000
* Opti-MEM

## Procedure

1. For a 10 cm plate with 10 ml of media and HEK293T/17 cells at 60% confluency prepare a solution with 7 ug of total amount of DNA (lentiviral vector(s), Pax-2 and VSV-G). Mix 14 ul of Lipofectamine in 750 ul of Opti-MEM, mix 7 ug of DNA in 750 ul of Opti-MEM, wait 5 minutes, mix the solutions and wait 20 minutes. Add the solution to the plate and rock the plate to mix well 

2. Transfer the plate to virus room and incubate overnight

3. Change media after overnight incubation and incubate for 48 hours

4. After 48 hours, filter the media from HEK293T/17 cells through a 0.45 um filter into a 15 ml tube.

5. Add Polybrene (2 ug/ml) to the filtered media (Our Polybrene stock is 10 mg/ml)

6. Aspirate media from the plate with cell line that is being infected

7. Add filtered media with Polybrene to the plate

8. Incubate 48 hours

9. Change the media to the one with antibiotic

10. Keep changing media with antibiotic every 2 days until the culture in control plates has been completely killed

11. Change media to standard media, without antibiotic used for selection
