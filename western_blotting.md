# Western blotting

## Wet transfer

Prepare a wet transfer sandwich:

* Black plate
* Black sponge
* 1 sheet of Whatman paper soaked in transfer buffer
* Gel
* PVDF membrane soaked in methanol for 15 seconds and then equilibrated in transfer buffer
* 1 sheets of Whatman paper soaked in transfer buffer
* Black sponge
* Transparent plate

Put a small magnetic stir bar in the wet transfer apparatus, insert the sandwich holder and an ice block. Put on the magnetic stirrer in the cold room and run overnight at constant amperage (1000 mAh/X h - 66.7 mA when run for 15 hours)

## Western blotting

* Block the membrane in 5% milk (5 g milk in 100 ml PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature. 
* Wash in PBS-T for 5 minutes to remove milk residue. 
* Incubate in primary antibody solution (diluted in 5% BSA) overnight at 4 Â°C. 
* Store the primary antibody and wash 4 times with PBS-T, 5 minutes each.
* Wash in 5% milk for 5 minutes
* Incubate with secondary antibody (mouse or rabbit 1:10000 dilution in 5% milk) for 1 hour at room temperature
* Discard the secondary antibody and wash 4 times with PBS-T, 5 minutes each.

## Imaging

* Prepare a 1:1 mix of ECL reagents in a falcon tube (1-2 ml per membrane)
* Put the membrane a inside plastic sheet protector and add ECL mix for 1 minute
* Image on the ChemiDock
