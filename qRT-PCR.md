# qRT-PCR

**Do this experiment on ice**

1.	Dilute cDNA 1/20 (e.g. 5 μl of cDNA + 95 μl of ddH2O). 
2.	Dilute primers 1/10 for a final concentration of 10 μM (e.g. 15 μl of primer + 135 μl of ddH2O). 
3.	For each sample, make the following mix (make extra to make sure you have enough):

	- 3.5 μl of ddH2O
	- 5.5 μl of SYBR green mix
	- 0.5 μl Forward primer
	- 0.5 μl Reverse primer

4.	Distribute 10 μl of the mix in each well of a white 96-well plate.
5.	Add 1 μl of cDNA (1/20) in the appropriate well. 
6.	Put the transparent seal on the plate.
7.	Centrifuge plate at 1,500 rpm for 1 minute. Cover with aluminium foil to protect from light. 
8.	Run in LightCycler 480 apparatus using the appropriate program. 

*Notes*:
- Make sure you use filter tips for this technique.
- You should make at least three replicates of each sample.
- The SYBR green mix is light sensitive and is stored at -80°C. Once thawed, it should be kept at  4°C.
