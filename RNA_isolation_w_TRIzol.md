# RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent

**Note: Use DNase- and RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes and tips**   
**TRIzol can be disposed in phenol/chloroform waste container**

*Place a bottle containing 75% ethanol at -20°C.* 


## Homogenization: 

1. Lyse adherent cells with 1 mL of TriZOL per 10 cm2 plate. 

	- 6-well plates: 1 mL TriZOL
	- 12-well plates: 400 μl TriZOL

## Phase separation: 

2.	Incubate at RT for 5-10 minutes. 
3.	Transfer to a 1.5 mL DNase- and RNase-free microcentrifuge tube by pipetting up and down until the cells dislodge.    	
	- Tubes can be frozen at -80°C at this point. 

4.	Add 200 μl of chloroform per mL of TriZOL used.
5.	Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds.
6.	Incubate at RT for 3 minutes.
7.	Centrifuge at 12,000 g at 4°C for 15 minutes.
	-	Upper colorless: aqueous phase (RNA) 
	-	White interphase: proteins
	-	Lower red: phenol-chloroform phase (DNA)

## RNA precipitation: 

2.	 Transfer the aqueous phase (upper) to a new microcentrifuge tube.
3.	 Add 500 μl of isopropanol per mL of TriZOL used. Vortex to mix.
4.	 Incubate at RT for 10 minutes.
5.	 Centrifuge at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes.

## RNA wash: 

2.	 Remove the supernatant.
3.	 Wash with 1 mL of cold 75% ethanol (previously placed at -20°C). Vortex to mix.
4.	 Centrifuge at 7,500 g at 4°C for 5 minutes.

## Redissolving the RNA:

2.	 Remove the supernatant.
3.	 Air-dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 minutes. Do not let the pellet dry completely.
4.	 Dissolve the RNA in 40 μl of DNase- and RNase-free water.
5.	 Incubate at 55°C for 10 minutes to dissolve the RNA pellet.

## DNase treatment: 

2.	For each sample, add 4 μl of DNase buffer 10X and 1 μl of rDNase I.
3.	Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4.	Add 4.5 μl of DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion). Shake well. Incubate at RT for 2 minutes.
5.	Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
