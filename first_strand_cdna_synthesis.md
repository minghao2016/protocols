# First Strand cDNA synthesis (RT-PCR)

**Note: Use DNase- and RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes and filter tips**

1. Make a master mix (number of samples + 2) of the following components:
	1 μl random primers
	1 μl 10 mM dNTP
2. In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 1 μg of total RNA and make up to 12 μl with DNase- and RNase-free water
3. Add 2 μl of the master mix in each tube, vortex the master mix often
4. Incubate the tubes at 65 °C for 5 minutes
5. Incubate on ice for at least 1 minute
6. Centrifuge the tubes briefly to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube
7. Prepare a master mix (number of sample + 1) of the following reagents:
	4 μl 5X First-Strand Buffer
	1 μl 0.1 M DTT
	1 μl of SuperScript III RT (200units/μl)
8. Distribute 6 μl in each tube and mix by gently pipetting up and down
9. Incubate at 25 °C (room temperature) for 5 minutes
10. Incubate at 50 °C for 50 minutes
11. Inactivate the reaction by incubating the tubes at 70 °C for 15 minutes
